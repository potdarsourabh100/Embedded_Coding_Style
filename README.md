# Embedded_Coding_Style

## The Important Rule
This coding style guide is designed to help you write clean, consistent, and maintainable embedded code. However, if any part of this guide feels unclear or overwhelming, don’t stress!

The best approach in such cases is to imitate the style of the surrounding code or follow the examples provided. By doing so, you ensure that your work remains consistent with the rest of the project, which is a key aspect of good coding practices.

## Remember:

- Consistency matters more than perfection.
- If you're in doubt, ask for clarification or feedback when possible.
- Over time, as you gain more familiarity, the reasoning behind these guidelines will become clearer, and you’ll naturally internalize them.

### Start small, follow the flow, and you’ll do great!
